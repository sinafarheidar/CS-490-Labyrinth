# CS-490-Labyrinth

This project is for CS 490 Capstone Fall 2023

This project is cybersecurity in nature and is a form of private keys and gates using Lattice based encryption.
The encyption is used for the generated keys and passes from the program generation to the database that holds the files.
Once the key and the user are verified to be allowed to request access and the key is correct then the user can access and use the files requested.
Files can be read and written to by the user.
Once the user exits the program or terminates their connection to the database then the key used will no longer be valid. Once a key has been used to establish a connection it cannot be used again.
